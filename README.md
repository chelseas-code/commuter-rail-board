# Interview takehome

I wanted to dip my toe in the React water to show that I could pick up some basics of a framework within a couple of hours so  bootstrapped this with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

npm

python3

## To start the front end 

In the project directory, you run:

'npm start'


## To start the back end open a new tab and CD to api

In the /api directory run

'python3 -m venv venv'

'source venv/bin/activate'

Since we're installing only 3 libraries and this is a one off, we won't bother with a requirements.txt

'pip install flask python-dotenv requests'

and then

'flask run'

than go to localhost:3000


Main files I wrote code in are

src/App.js 

api/api.py
